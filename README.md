# Technical assignment: Data Quality Analyst

This is my solution to the Technical assignment: Data Quality Analyst.

## Reading files and folder structure

Folders are divded per task and within each folder a number of files are found which combined servces as answers to a task.

- Task #1 folder contains one SQL file which covers all 10 subtasks with comments when needed to describe the approach on solving the task.
- Task #2 folder contains a Word file as a standalone file with answers.
- Task #3 folder contains an Excel file with delivered files added as tabs (filename_raw) and a tab (GB_videos) for data analysis of the delivered CSV, and a Word file with Python screenshot and references to the Excel file.

## Software used for the assignment

- MYSQL Workbench
- Jupyter Notebook, Python including Pandas libary
- Microsoft Office Word and Excel
